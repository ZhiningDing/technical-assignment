# Mintlify Technical Assignment

Goal: A miniaturized website status monitoring dashboard

There are many tools that monitor the up-time of websites. Today you will be making a miniaturized version of a website monitoring dashboard. A website's uptime can typically be determined by a status 2xx to indicate it is available and status 4xx/5xx otherwise.

## Requirements

1. **Frontend**: A single page web-app with the following components

- A list of different websites (Google, Netflix, GitHub, etc.) and a status on whether they are "Available" or "Unavailable"
- The data from the list must come from a REST API

2. **Backend**: a server that does the following

- Monitor a small handful of websites and check if they are currently available (status 200) or unavailable (status 400 or 404). This can be a hard-coded list.
- Return that list of those deployments, including the name and status, that's to be used by the frontend to display the status as a list.

3. **Hosting**: Deploy the app using any hosting provider you would like, and send us a link to the dashboard

## Submission Requirements
- A link to the dashboard 
- Please invite @hanywang and @hahnbeelee to the private repository 
- *Must be submitted within 48 hours*
