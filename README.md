# Mintlify Technical Assignment

Goal: A miniaturized monitoring website status dashboard with the following requirements

1. **Frontend**: A single page web-app with the following components

- A list of different "deployments" and a status on whether they are "Available" or "Unavailable"
- The data from the list must come from a REST API

2. **Backend**: a server that does the following

- Monitor a small handful of websites (Google, Netflix, GitHub, etc.) and check if they are currently available (status 200) or unavailable (status 400 or 404). This can be a hard-coded list.
- Return that list of those deployments, including the name and status, that's to be used by the frontend to display the status as a list.

3. **Hosting**: Deploy the app using any hosting provider you would like, and send us a link to the dashboard

A link to the dashboard and repository *must be submitted within 48 hours*.
